# Flow Builder Database Integration - Complete ✅

## What Was Done

Your Flow Builder is now **fully integrated** with the Supabase database! Here's what happens now:

---

## 🎯 **Complete Workflow**

### **1. Create Flow Button**

When you click **"Create Flow"** in the Flow Builder:

```
User clicks "Create Flow"
         ↓
Step 1: Creates flow in WhatsApp Business API
         ↓
Step 2: Saves flow to Supabase `forms` table
         ↓
Step 3: Shows success toast with Form ID
         ↓
Step 4: Refreshes "Manage Flows" list
```

**What gets saved to database:**

| Column | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `form_id` | Auto-generated | Database primary key |
| `form_name` | "Lucky Draw Registration" | Your flow name |
| `form_schema` | `{ screens: [...], version: '3.0' }` | Complete flow JSON |
| `flow_id` | "123456789" | WhatsApp Flow ID |
| `contest_id` | NULL (initially) | Can link to contest later |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | When created |

---

### **2. Manage Flows**

When you click **"Manage Flows"** (or the "Flows" button):

```
User clicks "Manage Flows"
         ↓
Loads flows from WhatsApp API
         ↓
Loads flows from Supabase database
         ↓
Merges both lists (shows which are saved in DB)
         ↓
Displays all flows with database info
```

**What you see:**

- ✅ **Flow Name** - From WhatsApp
- ✅ **Flow ID** - From WhatsApp  
- ✅ **Status** (PUBLISHED/DRAFT) - From WhatsApp
- ✅ **Form ID** - From Database (if saved)
- ✅ **Contest ID** - From Database (if linked)
- ✅ **"Saved in Database"** badge - Shows if flow is in Supabase

### **3. QR Code Generation**

When you scan the QR code:

```
User scans QR code
         ↓
Opens WhatsApp with flow
         ↓
User fills out flow
         ↓
Submits response
         ↓
Webhook receives response (if configured)
         ↓
Saves to `form_responses` table
         ↓
Creates participant (if linked to contest)
```

## 🔄 **Complete Data Flow Example**

### **Step 1: Create Flow**

```typescript
// User creates flow in Flow Builder
// Clicks "Create Flow"

// Result in database:
forms table:
  form_id: 15
  form_name: "Lucky Draw Registration"
  flow_id: "123456789"
  contest_id: NULL
  form_schema: { screens: [...] }
```

### **Step 2: View in Manage Flows**

```typescript
// User clicks "Manage Flows"

// Shows:
{
  id: "123456789",
  name: "Lucky Draw Registration",
  status: "PUBLISHED",
  formId: 15,              // ← From database
  contestId: null,         // ← From database
  savedInDatabase: true    // ← Badge shown
}
```

### **Step 3: User Scans QR & Submits**

```typescript
// User scans QR code and fills form

// Webhook receives:
{
  flow_id: "123456789",
  response_id: "response_xyz",
  data: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    phone: "1234567890"
  }
}

// Saved to database:
form_responses:
  response_id: 101
  form_id: 15
  flow_response_id: "response_xyz"
  response_data: { name: "John", email: "...", phone: "..." }

// If contest linked, also creates:
participants:
  participant_id: 55
  contest_id: 42
  form_response_id: 101
  name: "John Doe"
  contact: "1234567890"
  validated: false
```
