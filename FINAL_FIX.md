# üéØ FINAL FIX - Email Case Sensitivity Issue

## ‚úÖ What You've Done So Far
- Database shows all admins have `password123` ‚úÖ
- Passwords are correct ‚úÖ
- But login still fails for some admins ‚ùå

## üêõ The Problem

Looking at your console log:
```
‚ùå Admin not found in database for email: udith@gmail.com
```

But your database shows `udith@gmail.com` exists!

**Root Cause:** The email lookup might be case-sensitive or there are hidden spaces.

## üöÄ Quick Fix

### Step 1: Run Email Normalization Script

In **Supabase SQL Editor**, run:
```sql
-- Normalize all emails to lowercase and remove spaces
UPDATE admins 
SET email = LOWER(TRIM(email));

-- Verify
SELECT admin_id, email, password_hash, role FROM admins;
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
2. Clear **Cached images and files**
3. Clear **Cookies and site data**
4. Click **Clear data**

OR just do a hard refresh: **Ctrl + Shift + R**

### Step 3: Test Login Again

Try logging in with:
- Email: `udith@gmail.com` (all lowercase)
- Password: `password123`

---

## üîç Alternative: Check Exact Email in Database

Run this to see the exact email format:

```sql
SELECT 
  admin_id,
  email,
  LENGTH(email) as length,
  password_hash
FROM admins 
WHERE email LIKE '%udith%';
```

Then login with the **exact** email shown (copy-paste it).

## üéØ Complete Test Credentials

After running the email normalization, these should all work:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| mrudhula@gmail.com | password123 | MODERATOR |
| admin@ecam.com | [Supabase password] | SUPERADMIN |
| hrithik@gmail.com | password123 | MODERATOR |
| testadmin@example.com | password123 | ADMIN |
| udith@gmail.com | password123 | MODERATOR |

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Debug Steps:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Try to login** with `udith@gmail.com`
3. **Look for this specific log:**
   ```
   üîê Comparing passwords...
      - Stored password hash: password123
      - Provided password: password123
      - Match: true/false
   ```

4. **If you see "Admin not found":**
   - The email in your login form doesn't match the database
   - Copy the email directly from the database and paste it

5. **If you see "Password mismatch":**
   - Check if you're typing `password123` exactly (no spaces)
   - Check the console log to see what password is stored

## üîß Manual Fix for Specific Admin

If `udith@gmail.com` still doesn't work, run this:

```sql
-- Check exact email
SELECT email, password_hash FROM admins WHERE admin_id = 57;

-- If email is different, update it
UPDATE admins 
SET email = 'udith@gmail.com',
    password_hash = 'password123'
WHERE admin_id = 57;

-- Verify
SELECT email, password_hash FROM admins WHERE admin_id = 57;
```

Then try login again with exactly: `udith@gmail.com` / `password123`

## üÜò Last Resort

SELECT 
  'Email in DB' as check_type,
  email as value
FROM admins WHERE admin_id = 57

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Password in DB',
  password_hash
FROM admins WHERE admin_id = 57

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Email length',
  LENGTH(email)::text
FROM admins WHERE admin_id = 57

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Password length',
  LENGTH(password_hash)::text
FROM admins WHERE admin_id = 57;
```
