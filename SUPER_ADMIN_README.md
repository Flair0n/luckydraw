## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Super Admin Authentication
```
Super Admin → Supabase Auth → Auto-sync to admins table → Full permissions
Regular Admin → admins table → Limited permissions
```

### Visibility Control
```
Regular Admin queries admins table
    ↓
Automatic filter: is_super_admin = false
    ↓
Super Admin NEVER appears in results
```

### Route Protection
```tsx
<SuperAdminGuard>
  <SuperAdminOnlyContent />
</SuperAdminGuard>
```

## 🎯 What Super Admin Can Do

✅ View all admins (including themselves)  
✅ Create new admins  
✅ Edit any admin  
✅ Delete any admin

## 💻 Code Examples

### Get Admins (Filtered)
```typescript
// Regular admin view - Super Admin excluded
const admins = await AdminService.getAllAdmins();
```

### Get All Admins (Including Super Admin)
```typescript
// Super Admin view - includes everyone
const allAdmins = await AdminService.getAllAdmins(true);
```

### Protect a Route
```tsx
import { SuperAdminGuard } from '../components/auth/SuperAdminGuard';

export default function SuperAdminPage() {
  return (
    <SuperAdminGuard>
      <div>Super Admin Only Content</div>
    </SuperAdminGuard>
  );
}
```

### Check if Super Admin
```typescript
const isSuperAdmin = await AdminService.isSuperAdmin(adminId);
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Super Admin not appearing in admins table?

**Check metadata:**
```sql
SELECT raw_user_meta_data FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'your-superadmin@example.com';
```

Should contain: `{"is_super_admin": true}`

### Regular admins can see Super Admin?

**Verify RLS:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'admins';
```

### Can't login as Super Admin?

1. Check user exists in Supabase Auth
2. Verify user is confirmed (not pending)
3. Check password is correct
4. Look at browser console for errors
